# Project2-Group
Dennis Chase - My greatest strengths that matter for this class/project are orginization in coding and manipulating HTML and CSS code 
               for trial and error of multiple designs. JavaScript and coming up with ideas for starting out, once a major idea has started
               however I'm normally pretty good at piggybacking more ideas for smaller details.

Raiven Johnson- My primary strengths are getting awesome work done last minute and java and c++ even though those dont apply here. Also I work well with others(:
